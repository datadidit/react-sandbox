## Drag and Drop Research

* [React-DnD](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd): Was one of the earliest Drag and Drop third party libs for ReactJS. It's the most
customizable of the set. Customization comes with additional complications. That the below tools
wrap up and make easier for you. 
* [React Sortable Hoc](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc): Easy to use touch friendly sorting solution
even mentioned in article written by creator of DnD [here](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/the-future-of-drag-and-drop-apis-249dfea7a15f)
* [React Beautiful DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd): Came out a little bit later thann React Sortable Hoc. Is what
atlassian tools are using for their products.
